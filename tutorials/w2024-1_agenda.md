# Invitation

### Invitation text

Dear researcher and stakeholder interested in REMIND,
We are pleased to invite you to an online REMIND introductory workshop in November 2024, which for the first time is also aimed at external users. In three sessions, we will provide an overview of the content of the model as well as a technical look at the code and its structure. On each of the three days there will also be a practical part in which you will learn how to install and operate REMIND.
The workshop will take place from
Wed 20.11. - Fri 22.11.2024
from 8:00 a.m. -11:30 a.m. UTC (9-12:30 CET)

### where to distribute?
- REMIND GitHub repo

# Topics to cover (potentially) based on questionnaire

Expectation management at the beginning: we will not be able to solve all individual software problems, we can only solve individual cases as examples for everyone.
