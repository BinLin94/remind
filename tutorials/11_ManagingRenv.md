# Overview
REMIND uses the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) package for package management. When starting an R session or script from the REMIND folder the corresponding renv is automatically activated, and packages are installed to and loaded from the renv subfolder instead of the global package library. This isolation means that updates in the global package library do not affect REMIND which is especially important on multi-user systems where packages may be loaded by some users while others are updating these packages. In such a situation the loaded packages are no longer valid and R crashes. Another advantage of renv is that it documents exactly which packages are currently installed, and it makes it easy to go back to a previous package configuration via `renv.lock` files.
